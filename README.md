project 04 in the udemy course: The ultimate React Course 2023 by Jonas Schmedtmann.
Alterations:
* More steps have been added to the sequence
* Keylisteners added so we can move through steps using arrow keys
* App is broken up into components
* css improved (with button color and background color) and a means to deal with a shifting page when text is too long and moves the buttons down (a minimum height property)
